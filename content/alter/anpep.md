In the context of trauma related structural dissociation, there are the Apparently Normal Parts of the personality (ANP) and the Emotional Parts of the personality (EP). 

ANP are the parts that may appear normal, at least to some extent, as a result of negative dissociative symptoms. They are dissociated from the traumas that have been experienced and even after being made aware of a trauma, and overcoming any denial, will struggle to perceive it from a first person perspective. 

EP, however, are a manifestation of reactions to experiences of trauma and the memories pertaining to it. EP do not necessarily have to hold narrative memories of trauma, though this can also be the case, and may instead hold somatic reactions, beliefs, or behaviours related to the trauma.
