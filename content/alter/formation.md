Erdinç Öztürk and Vedat Şar theorise that there's 3 ways alters can form. The first is a traumatic break resulting from estrangement (essentially where the brain isn't able to integrate whatever's happened into an existing part so a new part breaks off) which is what most resembles the traditional "split" that people discuss in the context of DID/OSDD-1.

The second way is what is discussed as auto reparation, where a copy of a part at a given time, specific to the trauma that has occured, is made and acts as a sort of backup of the autobiographical events, which can later gain autonomy over time and create the basis for a new part.

But there's also the third way, which is the activation of potentials, where the brain creates an identical copy of an existing part and then distributes different abilities n characteristics between the copy and the original based on the needs for the current situation.
