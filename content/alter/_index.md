"Alter" is a term often given to the *alter*nate personality states experienced in DID and OSDD-1. These can vary in distinction from indistinct fragments to full-blown distinct identities. 

Historically alters have been referred to as multiple personalities, it's now generally considered that they are instead dissociative parts of a single personality and are seen as divided psycho-biological systems.

Other terms that have been used to refer to these dissociative parts include (dissociative) self-states, ego states, (dissociative) identity states, (dissociative) selves, (dissociative) identities, (dissociative) parts, (dissociative) personality states, and, colloquially, headmates.
