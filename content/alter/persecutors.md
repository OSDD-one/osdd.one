Many individuals with DID/OSDD-1 will have alters that demonstrate hostile or seemingly malicious behaviours towards others, whether it be externally to other people or internally towards other alters. These alters are often referred to as Persecutory Alters or Persecutors.

Persecutors are sometimes seen as evil or malignant due to the nature of their behaviours, but it is important to recognise that this is not the case and they are in fact still part of the brain to which they belong. Most often persecutors are exhibiting trauma responses and acting in a way that they believe to be in the best interests of themselves or the indvidual with DID/OSDD-1 as a whole.

Lisa Goodman and Jay Peters, building off the work of many professionals before them, describe persecutors as protectors who have shifted their aggressive behaviour in order to establish control over perceived threats. They identify two types of persecutors, the first knows why they behave as such (giving the example of a persecutor who hurts the host to prevent them from opening up about abuse, under the belief that the abuser would harm them in return), meanwhile the second does not have an awareness of the reason for their behaviour, and may simply believe they are a problem themselves. There is, however, a difference between not having an awareness of the reason and not having a reason. Exploring what the intended effect of the persecutor's behaviour is, conscious or not, can be key to reducing the fear that may be induced by a persecutor, and can in turn help to repair relationships between alters.
