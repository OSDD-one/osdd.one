Many individuals with DID/OSDD-1 will have alters that demonstrate hostile or seemingly malicious behaviours towards others, whether it be externally to other people or internally towards other alters. These alters are often referred to as Persecutory Alters or Persecutors.

Persecutors are sometimes seen as evil or malignant due to the nature of their behaviours, but it is important to recognise that this is not the case and they are in fact still part of the brain to which they belong. Most often persecutors are exhibiting trauma responses and acting in a way that they believe to be in the best interests of themselves or even the brain as a whole.
