A large part of what makes a personality is our thoughts, feelings, and behaviour, which Pierre Janet recognised as action systems. 
Action systems break down into two main categories, one pertaining to daily life and it's accompanying responsibilities, and the other pertaining to perceived threats and the avoidance or escape of them. 

The average persons' action systems develop such that they are integrated and function as a singular personality state. However, if a child's personality development is interrupted by traumatic experiences their personality becomes dissociated, they may develop parts pertaining to different action systems that are unintegrated and conflict with each other.
