This website is dedicated to providing information and resources surrounding the topic of Other Specified Dissociative Disorder 1. (OSDD-1)
The DSM-V defines dissociative disorders as being "characterized by a disruption of and/or discontinuity in the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body representation, motor control, and behavior".

The diagnosis of OSDD-1 is made when a patient is experiencing chronic and recurrent syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms, that do not fully meet the criteria of Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID).

The criteria of DID as per the DSM-V are as follows:
- Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states, which may be described in some cultures as an experience of possession. The disruption in identity involves marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency, accompanied by related alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs and symptoms may be observed by others or reported by the individual.
- Recurrent gaps in the recall of everyday events, important personal information, and/or traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting
- The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning
- The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice.
**Note:** In children, the symptoms are not better explained by imaginary playmates or other fantasy play
- The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures).

For the sake of simplicity, these can roughly be simplified down to the following

- Disruption of identity with a marked discontinuity in sense of self and agency, that is accompanied with alterations in affect.
This can be further simplified to being the presence of distinct alternate personality states, known as "alters".
- The presense of amnesia
- The symptoms cause distress or impairment
- The disturbance is not related to cultural or religious practices
- The symptoms are not better explained by something else

The description of OSDD-1 as per the DSM-V is as follows
- Chronic and recurrent syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms: This category includes identity disturbance associated with less-than-marked discontinuities in sense of self and agency, or alterations of identity or episodes of possession in an individual who reports no dissociative amnesia.

Prior to the DSM-V, the DSM-IV described this phenomenon under it's Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified classification, and designated subclassifications of 1a and 1b based on the DID criteria that the patient failed to meet (e.g. a patient not exhibiting the amnesia required for the B criteria of DID would be diagnosed with DDNOS-1b), whilst the DSM-V does not specify these subclassifications, it does expect the diagnostician to provide the reasoning the patient fits the OSDD diagnosis, as such some clinicians continue to utilise the 1a/b classifications in situations where a patient fits the traditional model of DDNOS, however there is a spectrum of experiences that can fall under OSDD-1 that may not fit this model, as discussed further in DID/OSDD as a Spectrum
