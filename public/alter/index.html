	<h4 id="what-is-an-alter">What is an Alter?</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Alter&rdquo; is a term given to the <em>alter</em>nate personality states experienced in DID/OSDD-1. These can vary in distinction from indistinct fragments to full-blown distinct identities. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Whilst historically alters have sometimes been referred to as being multiple personalities, it&rsquo;s now generally considered that they are dissociative parts of a single personality and are seen as divided psycho-biological systems.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Other terms that have been used to refer to these dissociative parts include (dissociative) self-states, ego states, (dissociative) identity states, (dissociative) selves, (dissociative) identities, (dissociative) parts, (dissociative) personality states, and, colloquially, headmates.</p>
<h4 id="action-systems">Action Systems</h4>
<p>A large part of what makes a personality is our thoughts, feelings, and behaviour, which can be said to all be defined by action systems.
Action systems break down into two main categories, one pertaining to daily life and it&rsquo;s accompanying responsibilities, and the other pertaining to perceived threats and the avoidance or escape of them.</p>
<p>The average persons' action systems develop such that they are integrated and function as a singular personality state. However, if a child&rsquo;s personality development is interrupted by traumatic experiences their personality becomes dissociated, they may develop alters pertaining to different action systems that are unintegrated and conflict with each other.</p>
<p>Apparently Normal Parts (of the Personality) (ANP) and Emotional Parts (of the Personality) (EP)</p>
<p>The Theory of Structural Dissociation identifies alters as belonging to either of two categories, either they function as apparently normal parts of the personality, or as emotional parts of the personality.
This connects to the two categories of action systems mentioned in the previous section, where ANP relate to daily life and EP relate to perceived threats.</p>
