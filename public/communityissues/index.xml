      <description>In complex dissociative disorders it is a common occurence that individuals may have parts of themselves that may present and appear as, or identify with, an age different to that of their actual age. This is often referred to as alter age.
It is important to note that alter ages are a substitute belief and are not necessarily reflective of one&amp;rsquo;s capacity to do certain things. The notion of a mental age separate to one&amp;rsquo;s chronological age is one that stems from the medical field&amp;rsquo;s attempts to remove autonomy from individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities.</description>
