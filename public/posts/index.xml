      <description>CW: Descriptions of ableism and transphobia, use of the R slur in a medical context
Whilst alters in a system may present with different levels of emotional maturity, feel a certain age, or appear younger in one&amp;rsquo;s headspace, this is not a literal age. It is okay for alters to identify with an age however it is important to note that this is not the same as being that age, as they are still physically (both in terms of physical stature and in terms of their neurological structures and pathways) the age of the body, as alter age is primarily conceptual and not literal.</description>
